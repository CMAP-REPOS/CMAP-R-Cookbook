This function will place a ggplot into a frame defined by CMAP design standards. It will align your title and caption to the left, add a horizontal line on top, and make other adjustments. It can show you the final plot and/or export it as a raster or vector file. This function will not apply CMAP design standards to the plot itself: use `theme_cmap()` for that.

The function has a number of customization options built in, accepting 16 (or more) arguments. These include
- `plot`: A ggplot object, the variable name of the plot you have created that you want to finalize. If null (the default), the most recent plot will be retrieved via `ggplot2::last_plot()`.
- `title` and `caption`: Character, the text you want to appear in the title and caption blocks. If empty, any non-Null values from `plot` will be retrieved. These blocks take html formatting, so manual text breaks can be created with `<br>` and formatting can be changed with `<span>`.
- `width` and `height`: Numeric, the dimensions for the output image, including the title. Units in inches, which interacts with `ppi` to define the pixel dimensions of raster outputs. Default is 9.31 inches wide (670/72) and 5.56 inches tall (400/72), to match Comms specification of 670px by 400px at 72ppi.
- `title_width`: Numeric, the width in inches for the title. If unspecified, use 25 percent of the total output width (per Comms guidance).
- `ppi`: Numeric, the resolution of exported images (pixels per inch). Default = 300.
- `mode`: Vector, the action(s) to be taken with the plot. Save using any of the following: `png`, `tiff`, `jpeg`, `bmp`, `svg`, `pdf`, `ps`. View in R with: `plot`, `window`: (`window` currently works only on computers running Windows). Return an object with `object`.
- `filename`: Character, the file path and name you want the plot to be saved to. You may specify an extension to use. If you don't, the correct extension will be added for you.
- `caption_valign`: Character, align the caption text at the top or the bottom of the available space between the title and bottom of image. This argument accepts abbreviations, too: `c("top", "t", "bottom", "b")`. Without an argument, this defaults to `top`.
- `fill_bg` and `fill_canvas`: Character, strings that represent colors R can interpret. They are used to fill behind and around the finished plot, respectively, and default to `white` for the background and `gray90` for the canvas.
- `overrides`: Named list, overrides the default drawing attributes defined `cmapplot_globals$consts` which are drawn by `finalize_plot()` (this is most of them). Units are in bigpts (1/72 of an inch).
- `debug`: Logical, setting this to `TRUE` enables outlines around components of finalized plot. Default = `FALSE`.
- `legend_build`: Character, how the function attempts to build the legend. `"adjust"`, the default, attempts to align the legend all the way left (on top of the y axis labels) per CMAP design standards. `"safe"` maintains the alignment used in the original plot.
- `legend_bump`: Numeric, shift the legend left (positive) or right (negative) this amount. Depending on system configuration, it may be necessary to use this parameter to achieve exact left alignment (this can most easily be tested using `debug = TRUE`). Expressed in bigpts.
- `...`: This argument passes additional arguments to `ggplot2::theme()` to override any elements of the default CMAP theme.
