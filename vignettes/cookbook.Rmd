This vignette is a showcase of cmapplot's full capabilities by replicating as closely as possible a variety of published CMAP graphics. The sample code here can be used as a starting point for creating a number of common chart types. Before running any of this code, be sure to load the both tidyverse and cmapplot packages with `library(tidyverse)` and `library(cmapplot)`.


## Line graph

Line graphs are useful for showing change over time, and are well-suited for combination with `geom_text_lastonly()` and `geom_recessions()` custom geoms. This particular plot also demonstrates the utility of a few other functions from the tidyverse that are quite useful when working with `ggplot2::ggplot()`:

- `forcats::fct_reorder()` and `forcats::fct_reorder2()` are useful to automatically order of factors within `mapping`, which establishes legend order. (See also [the relevant R4DS chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html#modifying-factor-order).)

- functions from the `scales` package, such as `scales::percent()` and `scales::label_percent()`, which reformat numbers into attractive formats.

- ggplot2 scale functions, such as `ggplot2::scale_x_continuous()`, which allow for control over the extent and breaks of each axis. 

#### Example code

```{r line, fig.asp=4.5/(670/72), message=FALSE}
# Get example dataset, and create a relative GRP field
df <- peer_grp %>% 
  group_by(area) %>% 
  mutate(indexed = grp / first(grp) - 1)


# Create line plot
p <- ggplot(
  data = df,
  mapping = aes(
    x = year,
    y = indexed,
    color = fct_reorder2(area, year, indexed),  # Order legend by last `indexed` value in last `year`
    label = scales::percent(indexed, accuracy = 1)  # Format labels as percents with no decimals
  )
) +
  
  # Add geoms, making sure to keep recessions under lines
  geom_recessions(ymin = 0, ymax = .5) +
  geom_line(lineend = "round") +
  geom_text_lastonly() +
  
  # Establish an attractive Y scale
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1),
    expand = expansion(add = 0)  # No padding beyond specified limits
  ) +
  
  # Establish an attractive X scale
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(from = min(df$year), to = max(df$year), by = 2),  # Set breaks to every other year
    expand = expansion(add = c(0.5, 1.25))  # Set custom padding for L/R sides of axis 
  ) +
  
  # Apply CMAP theme and color palette
  theme_cmap(
    overrides = list(margin_panel_r = 3)  # Shrink distance btwn gridlines ending and plotting extent
  ) +
  cmap_color_discrete(palette = "legislation")
  

# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  title = "Cumulative growth in real gross regional product, 2001-19",
  caption = "Note: Index year 2001.<br><br>

  # Tweak plot layout
  height = 4.5,
  title_width = 2.6,
  overrides = list(
    margin_plot_r = 0,  # Eliminate distance btwn plot and right side of image
    margin_legend_b = 25  # Larger than usual gap between legend and plot
  )
)
```

## Area plot

Area plots are useful for showing changes in composition over time. (See also: [Stacked bar chart].)

#### Example code

```{r area, message=FALSE}
# Get & format example dataset
df <- cmapplot::transit_ridership %>%
  filter(!is.na(ridership)) %>% # Remove entries with no ridership (in this case, 
                            #  values before PACE ADA is broken out in the data)
  
  # Change system names to desired legend output
  mutate(system = recode(system, 
                         "cta_bus" = "CTA Bus",
                         "cta_rail" = "CTA Rail",
                         "metra" = "Metra",
                         "pace" = "Pace",
                         "pace_ada" = "Pace ADA")) %>%
  
  # Make into factor with defined order for plotting (top to bottom)
  mutate(system = factor(system, levels = c(
    "Pace ADA", "Pace", "Metra", "CTA Rail", "CTA Bus"
  )))

# Create area plot
p <- ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = year, y = ridership, fill = system)) +
  
  # Add the area plot
  geom_area() +
  
  # Add the desired color palette
  cmap_fill_discrete(palette = "legislation") +
  
  # Apply the CMAP theme
  theme_cmap(gridlines = "hv") +
  
  # Reverse the order of the legend (optional)
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))


# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  title = "Annual unlinked passenger trips on Regional Transportation Authority
    systems over time, by service board (in millions).",
  caption = "Source: CMAP analysis of RTA data.")
```

## Scatterplot

Scatterplots show relationships between two numeric variables, plotted on the x- and y-axes. Additionally, color and size can be used to represent additional variables.

#### Example code

```{r scatter, message=FALSE}
# Create example dataset
df <- tibble(
  REGION = c("Boston", "Chicago", "Los Angeles", "New York", "Washington, D.C."),
  TOT_POP_DIFF = c(41695, -114387, 110955, 322308, 198931),
  LF_POP_DIFF = c(46296, -68524, 113307, 315163, 173036),
  LF_RATE_DIFF_MAG = c(0.5349653, 0.684531, 0.4036736, 0.5853668, 0.0386677),
  LF_RATE_DIFF_DIR = c("Increase", "Increase", "Increase", "Increase", "Decrease")
)


# Create scatterplot
p <- ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = TOT_POP_DIFF, y = LF_POP_DIFF)) +

  # Apply CMAP theme with optional arguments
  theme_cmap(
    xlab = "Change in population aged 25-54",  # Label x-axis
    ylab = "Change in size of labor force aged 25-54",  # Label y-axis
    hline = 0, vline = 0,  # Add horizontal and vertical origin lines at 0
    gridlines = "hv"  # Include both horizontal and vertical gridlines
  ) +

  # Adding points after theme_cmap() puts points in front of origin lines
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    size = LF_RATE_DIFF_MAG,  # Associate point size with a variable
    color = LF_RATE_DIFF_DIR  # Associate point color with a variable
  )) +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(label = REGION)) +  # Label each point with its name

  # Manually adjust point size/color aesthetics and legend items
  scale_size(range = c(5, 25)) +  # Minimum/maximum size of points
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(`Increase` = cmap_palettes$legislation[1],  # Modify point colors
               `Decrease` = cmap_palettes$legislation[2]),
    breaks = c("Increase", "Decrease"),  # Specify order of legend items
    labels = c("Increase in labor force\nparticipation rate",  # Modify legend labels for each color
               "Decrease in labor force\nparticipation rate")  # ("\n" inserts a line break)
  ) +
  guides(size = "none",  # Omit size aesthetic from legend
         color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +  # Increase legend point size

  # Adjust gridlines and their labels
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma(),  # Format x-axis numbers with commas
                     limits = c(-200000, 400000),     # Set x-axis limits
                     n.breaks = 7,                    # Set number of gridlines on x-axis
                     expand = expansion(mult = 0)) +  # No padding beyond specified limits
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma(),  # Format y-axis numbers with commas
                     limits = c(-200000, 400000),     # Set y-axis limits
                     n.breaks = 7,                    # Set number of gridlines on y-axis
                     expand = expansion(mult = 0)) +  # No padding beyond specified limits
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    angle = 45,   # Set an angle for the x-axis numbers,
    hjust = 1,    # a horizontal justification (between 0-1, trial & error),
    vjust = 1     # and a vertical justification (between 0-1, trial & error).
  ))


# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  title = "Changes in population, size of labor force, and labor force
    participation rate among prime working age residents (ages 25-54), Chicago
    and select Metropolitan Statistical Areas, 2006-10 to 2013-17",
  caption = "Size of bubble represents the absolute value of percentage point

## Highlighted bar chart

The cmapplot package includes functionality for highlighting specified data using a distinct color. This is useful to compare Chicago against peer regions, for example.

#### Example code

```{r highlightbar, message=FALSE}
# Create example dataset
df <- tibble(
  REGION = c("Boston", "Chicago", "Los Angeles", "New York", "Washington, D.C."),
  MED_HH_INC = c(77809, 63327, 62216, 69211, 93804)
)


# Create highlighted bar chart
p <- ggplot(data = df,
            mapping = aes(
              x = reorder(REGION, -MED_HH_INC), # Order race by decreasing income
              y = MED_HH_INC,
              fill = REGION  # Fill must be set for a highlighted chart
            )) +

  # Add bars
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +

  # Add horizontal line at specified value
  geom_hline(yintercept = 55322) +

  # Label bars
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(
      y = MED_HH_INC + 2500,  # Offset by trial & error
      label = scales::label_dollar()(MED_HH_INC)  # Format labels as dollars
    ),
    hjust = .5  # Center label (0 = left aligned, 1 = right aligned)
  ) +

  # Annotate the horizontal line
  annotate(
    geom = "text",
    x = 5.6, y = 52822, # Specify position of annotation (trial & error)
    label = "U.S. Average $55,322",
    hjust = 1 # Right align the text
  ) +

  # Wrap long labels along the x-axis
  scale_x_discrete(labels = scales::label_wrap(12)) +

  # Format y-axis numbers as percentages, and set axis limits
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar(),
                     limits = c(0, 100000),
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100000, by = 10000)) +

  # Apply CMAP theme and color palette
  theme_cmap() +
  cmap_fill_highlight(field = df$REGION, value = "Chicago") +

  # Omit fill aesthetic from legend
  guides(fill = "none")


# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  title = "Median household income in select metropolitan statistical areas, 2016",
  caption = "Source: Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning analysis of U.S.
    Census Bureau data."
)
```

## Clustered bar chart

Clustered bar charts allow for multiple variables to be graphed adjacent to one another for the same category. For example, in the chart below, we show Census self-response rates by demogrphic group, with responses from 2020 adjacent to responses from 2010 for each sub-group.

Note that `ggplot2` has two elements that can be used to generate bar charts: `geom_col()` and `geom_bar()`. In most cases, `geom_col()` will be correct, as it will graph the values supplied as heights on the x- or y-axis by default. `geom_bar()` can do the same, but only if the user sets `stat = "identity"`.

The chart below also demonstrates three other `ggplot2` tools that may be of interest: adding value labels above each of the bars; adding a value line (in this case, the regional average at 69%); and adding an annotation above that line to indicate what that line represents.

#### Example code

```{r clusterbar, message=FALSE}
# Create example dataset
df <- tibble(
  RACE = c("White", "White", "No majority", "No majority", "Asian", "Asian", "Hispanic", "Hispanic", "Black", "Black"),
  YEAR = c("2010", "2020", "2010", "2020", "2010", "2020", "2010", "2020", "2010", "2020"),
  RESPONSE = c(.760, .761, .670, .671, .634, .605, .625, .550, .580, .550)
) %>%
  mutate(LABEL = sprintf("%i%%", as.integer(round(RESPONSE * 100,0))))


# Create clustered bar chart
p <- ggplot(data = df,
            mapping = aes(
              x = reorder(RACE, -RESPONSE), # Order race by decreasing response rate
              y = RESPONSE, fill = YEAR
            )) +
  
  # Add gap between bars in same cluster
  geom_col(width = 0.65,  # Width should be less than position_dodge(width)
           position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +  # Difference of 0.05 is usually sufficient
  
  # Add horizontal dashed line at specified value
  geom_hline(yintercept = .69, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray") +
  
  # Add and format value labels for each bar on the graph
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(
      label = LABEL,
      y = RESPONSE + .025),  # Shift upward to eliminate overlap
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.7),  # Match geom_col's width
    hjust = .5  # Center label (0 = left aligned, 1 = right aligned)
  ) +
  
  # Annotate the dashed line
  annotate(
    geom = "text",
    x = 5.6, y = 0.715, # Specify position of annotation (trial & error)
    label = "2020 Chicago region average: 69%",
    hjust = 1, # Right align the text
    color = "gray" # set the color of the text (here, matched to above)
  ) +
  
  # Format y-axis numbers as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  
  # Apply CMAP theme and color palette
  theme_cmap() +
  cmap_fill_discrete(palette = "governance")


# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  title = "Average self-response rates in Chicago region census tracts by
    majority race and ethnicity",
  caption = "Note: These figures are weighted averages based on tract-level

## Stacked bar chart

Stacked bar charts allow for the bars to represent multiple variables: the sub-bars represent individual components of a group, and the total bar height represents the sum of all of the group's components.

#### Example code

```{r stackbar, message=FALSE}
# Get & format example dataset from ON TO 2050 indicators GitHub repository
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMAP-REPOS/ONTO2050-indicators/master/non-single-occupancy-modes/non-single-occupancy-modes.csv") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("PCT_NONSOV"),
               names_to = "MODE",
               names_prefix = "PCT_NONSOV_",
               values_to = "PCT_NONSOV") %>%
  filter(MODE != "TOTAL",
         ACTUAL_OR_TARGET == "Actual") %>%
  mutate(MODE = recode(MODE,
                       "CARPOOL" = "Carpool",
                       "TRANSIT" = "Public transportation",
                       "BIKE" = "Bicycle",
                       "WALK" = "Walk",
                       "HOME" = "Work at home")) %>%
  mutate(MODE = factor(MODE, levels = c(

                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 35, by = 5)) +

  # Label every bar along x-axis
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = length(unique(df$YEAR))) +

  # Apply CMAP theme and color palette

## Faceted histograms

While statistics such as mean or median are useful for summarizing, they just scratch the surface of trends happening within a large, diverse dataset. Histograms are great for visualizing the distribution of a metric across a large sample. This particular example shows the distribution of tour beginnings and endings over the continuous variable of time. However, the continuous variable has already been made discrete by binning time in half-hour increments and summing the tours in each bin. In cases like this, `geom_col()` is the geom that makes the most sense. If your variable comes in a true continuous form, `geom_histogram()` is appropriate, and allows flexibility for bin sizes. If your variable is discrete/categorical and has not been summarized, `geom_bar()` is the best choice.

To make histograms even more interesting, split your data up by important categories and visualize them side-by-side to understand how distributions vary for different groups. `facet_grid()` is used here because comparisons are being made across the values of two discrete variables. If you want to split up your graph by only one variable, `facet_wrap()` will do. 

Some smaller formatting choices to pay attention to:

- `dplyr::recode_factor()` changes the column labels to "Departure" and "Return" for clarity. `forcats::fct_rev()` reverses the order in which the factors appear on the graph. Character/text variables can be converted to factors by `factor()` or `forcats::as_factor()` (which use different rules to determine the factor order).

- Similar to graphs above which needed special formatting on their axis labels, `ggplot2::scale_x_time()` is used to manage the range, breaks, and labels of the x-axis, specifically when that axis represents time. 

- `lubridate::hm()` converts strings into time period objects. Lubridate is a very useful package if you need to manage dates and times. Learn more about it [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html).


#### Example code

```{r histogram, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Get & format example dataset from ABM validation report GitHub repository
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMAP-REPOS/cmap_abm_report/master/data/csv37_tours_tod.csv") %>%

## Donut chart (or pie chart)

The donut chart is a CMAP favorite for visualizing percentages of a whole. It is a variant of the pie chart, where the center has been replaced by a hole. While ggplot2 does not have a native geom for donut or pie charts, they can be constructed with a combination of `geom_rect()` and `coord_polar()`.

#### Example code

```{r donut, message=FALSE}
# Create example dataset
df <- tibble(
  SECTOR = c("Stationary energy", "Transportation", "Waste"),
  EMISSIONS = c(81.9, 34.3, 3.2)
)


# Create donut chart
p <- df %>%

  # Compute temporary variables needed for constructing the donut segments
  mutate(
    fraction = EMISSIONS / sum(EMISSIONS),
    xmax = cumsum(fraction),
    xmin = lag(xmax, default = 0)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(mapping = aes(fill=SECTOR)) +

    # Create donut segments as rectangles of proportional width, fixed height
    geom_rect(mapping = aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax,
                            ymin = 2, ymax = 3)) +

    # Add formatted labels to center of each donut segment
    geom_text(mapping = aes(label = sprintf("%.0f%%", fraction * 100),
                            x = (xmax+xmin)/2,
                            y = 2.5),
              color = "white") +  # Change label color

    # Switch from rectangular to circular grid, centered at y=0
    # `start` (in radians) by trial and error to match original graphic
    coord_polar(start = 4.88) +
    ylim(c(0, 3)) +  # Without this, result would be a pie chart

    # Apply CMAP theme (without gridlines) and a color palette
    theme_cmap(gridline = "none") +
    cmap_fill_discrete(palette = "community") +

    # Turn off axis labels
    theme(axis.text = element_blank())


# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  # use HTML tags to customize breaks in title, caption
  title = "Regional emissions<br>by sector, 2015",
  caption = "Source: Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.",
  caption_valign = "top")
```

## Race and ethnicity time series line graph

Given CMAP's focus on inclusive growth, many of our graphics depict data by race and ethnicity. Notably, several of the ON TO 2050 indicators track trends over time by race and ethnicity. For these cases, the cmapplot package includes a special race/ethnicity color palette that can be applied to the `color` or `fill` aesthetics of any geom.

#### Example code

```{r racepalette, message=FALSE}
# Get & format example dataset from ON TO 2050 indicators GitHub repository
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMAP-REPOS/ONTO2050-indicators/master/household-income-race-ethnicity/household-income-race-ethnicity.csv") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("MED_HH_INC"),
               names_to = "RACE_ETH",
               names_prefix = "MED_HH_INC_",
               values_to = "MED_HH_INC") %>%
  mutate(RACE_ETH = recode(RACE_ETH,
                           "ALL" = "All",
                           "ASIAN" = "Asian",
                           "BLACK" = "Black",
                           "HISPANIC" = "Hispanic",
                           "WHITE" = "White (non-Hispanic)"))


# Create line graph with race/ethnicity palette
p <- ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = YEAR, y = MED_HH_INC, color = RACE_ETH)) +

  # Add lines and label final value with dollar formatting
  geom_line() +
  geom_text_lastonly(mapping = aes(label = scales::label_dollar()(MED_HH_INC)),
                     add_points = TRUE) +

  # Don't clip labels
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +

  # Manually set axis limits and format y-axis labels as dollars
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2005, 2020)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100000),
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100000, by = 10000),
                     labels = scales::label_dollar()) +

  # Apply CMAP theme and apply race/ethnicity palette
  theme_cmap() +
  cmap_color_race(white = "White (non-Hispanic)",
                  black = "Black",
                  hispanic = "Hispanic",
                  asian = "Asian",
                  other = "All")


# Create final plot
finalize_plot(
  p,
  title = "Median household income by race and ethnicity, 2006-2019, in 2016
    inflation-adjusted dollars",
  caption = "Source: CMAP analysis of American Community Survey data, 1-year
    estimates.",
  caption_valign = "top"
)
```
